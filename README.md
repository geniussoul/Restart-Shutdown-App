🔥 Restart-Shutdown-App 🔁🛑
“Because dragging a mouse to shut down is so 2002.”

📦 Project Description
A smooth, cross-platform Python script that lets you restart or shut down your machine from the command line — like a boss 😎.
Forget the mouse. Forget the clickfest. This is raw, keyboard-powered control.
It’s minimalist, fast, and lets your terminal speak the language of power.

🧨 Whether you're automating workflows, building desktop scripts, or just flexing your inner hacker — this one’s got your back.

🌟 Features That Slap
💥 Feature	🤘 Description
🔘 Shutdown Mode	Power off like a legend — gracefully and cleanly
🔁 Restart Mode	Need a reboot? Boom, one key away
🎯 Interactive CLI	Menus so smooth, they feel like butter
🛡️ Confirmation Guard	“Are you sure?” before triggering digital annihilation
🧠 OS Smartness	Knows your OS, handles commands accordingly (Windows/Linux/macOS — no bias)
🧪 Pure Python	Zero dependencies. Just os, sys, and your will to automate

🧠 Why I Made This
Because sometimes you’re in the zone, and the last thing you want to do is wrestle with a mouse like it’s 1999.
Also... because my laptop deserved a dramatic exit — with style.

⚡ This was my exercise in:

Understanding OS-level commands

Designing clean CLI interfaces

Keeping things lightweight, readable, and dead simple

And let's be honest... shutting down with code just feels cooler.
